# warehouse-location-management

This project allocates incoming merchandise to appropriate warehouse locations. It ensures that the warehouse floor (and height) is used efficiently in order to avoid situations where one product occupies more space than it needs to.
This was inspired by challenges I faced when working in a warehouse where the workers had to constantly manually move merchandise around whenever we had new products coming in. I felt then that if the products were initially allocated more efficiently by the warehouse management system to locations, there would be no need to spend extra manpower and time moving the products again.
